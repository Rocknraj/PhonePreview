This is something I created for previewing mobile sites and applications. It is very simple and
for previewing layouts, though that is frequently half the battle and more! This is not a full
fledged emulator by any means, but it is a little easier in some workflows than picking up a phone
to do a quick front-end preview.

In the future I may work in some server side coding to make this return a mobile device user agent.
I plan to add orientation changing sometime soon.
